# Genetic-Optimization
The genetic algorithm to find max and min coefficients of a trading strategy.  
This repository contains a Python implementation of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) designed to optimize numerical functions. The algorithm leverages evolutionary principles such as mutation, recombination, and selection to iteratively improve solutions.
